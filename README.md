# Dynamic-Bootstrap-Carousel
This project will allow users to build custom bootstrap carousels that are completely data driven. Need another slide, just add another object. Each slide will create a new pagination button, carousel indicators, and captions. You can easily remove these features if you wish. This project currently supports text, image, video, and text/img as options for slides. Practicing Merging
